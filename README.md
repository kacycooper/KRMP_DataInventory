# california_kelp_GBIF_OBIS

We were contacted by Kacy Cooper and Erin Satterthwaite asking for assistance in querying GBIF and OBIS for a California kelp dataset inventory. See emails below.

Hi Steve,
This is super helpful! Assistance with the API would be amazing! We do only prefer the metadata and I do think itâ€™s worth being a bit more precise and doing both OBIS and GBIF.  Our bounding box would be off CA (ideally state waters but since kelp generally are nearshore anyway the CA EEZ will work great. And yes, we just want metadata. 
Thanks again for helping to get us started! Hope you are well :) 
Best,
Erin

Yes, if you click on the download tab above the map, you can choose a variety of download options. It will give you all the occurrences, and you can filter it to those datasets.  "Simple" will give you just the csv and the DOI you can cite:

  

If you're really only looking for dataset metadata, we can do that through the API pretty easily.  Also, I'm not sure how y'all will be using this in the end, but if it's worth being more precise, so the OBIS and GBIF search is exactly the same, I'm happy to whip up the code and csv output for y'all, I just need a little more info:

Boundaries: US EEZ off California? or some bounding box or polygon?
output: Do you want all the occurrences, or just dataset metadata? 

Happy Holidays!
Steve

Thanks, Stephen! One quick question -- is there a way from the view/link you shared to download a csv of the datasets (see list below)?
Best,
Erin

Hi Kacy,

Since you're doing an inventory, it may be worth looking at GBIF too.  Here is a quick and dirty search of those two species off California: https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/map?has_coordinate=true&taxon_key=4267628&taxon_key=5422328&advanced=1&geometry=POLYGON((-128.63769%2016.27273,-108.68281%2016.27273,-108.68281%2048.34307,-128.63769%2048.34307,-128.63769%2016.27273))&occurrence_status=present

GBIF offers an R package, rgbif, and a python package, pygbif, to do this more programmatically.  Let me know if you'd like help refining the queries and comparing the results of the two databases.

Cheers,
Steve

Hi Abby,

Thank you for getting back to us and sending the code! We'll take a look and then reach out to Steve if we have any questions.

Thanks again!

Best,
Kacy

Hi Kacy,

This is pretty easy to do using the robis package in R. It probably makes the most sense for you to do it so you can change the parameters to fit your needs. Here is the code I used:
> areas <- robis::area()
Retrieved 798 records of approximately 798 (100%)
> View(areas)
> kelpList <- robis::dataset(scientificname = c("Macrocystis pyrifera","Nereocystis luetkeana"), areaid = 274)
Retrieved 6 records of approximately 6 (100%)
> View(kelpList)

OBIS AreaID 274 is the US North Pacific EEZ.

I am currently on a detail with USGCRP working on the US National Nature Assessment (call for authors out now! ðŸ™‚) so I've cc'ed Steve Formel who is now the node manager for OBIS-USA and should be able to assist you further if needed.

Warmly,
Abby

Hi Abby,

Hope you're doing well! I'm a 2023 California Sea Grant Fellow working with Erin Satterthwaite on the California Kelp Restoration and Management Plan. As part of this project, I am helping to create an inventory of kelp-relevant ecological and social datasets.

We are reaching out to see if you could help us obtain a list of kelp-related datasets within the OBIS platform. Erin mentioned you would be a good person to connect with. 

Specifically, we are wondering if you could send us a list of all giant and bull kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera and Nereocystis luetkeana) relevant datasets within the OBIS platform with metadata including dataset name, program, contact name, and email/phone number), preferably as a csv file. We are only focusing on kelp data within California waters. 

Is this something that you can help with? If not, could you recommend or put us in contact with someone who could?

I'm happy to hop on a call to discuss further and answer any questions. We look forward to hearing from you!

Best,
Kacy
