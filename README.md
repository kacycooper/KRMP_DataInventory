# KRMP_DataInventory

This is a repository as part of the Kelp Restoration Management Plan process (KRMP). The aim is to compile and organize kelp-relevant ecological and social datasets to identify what datasets exist, their accessibility, data content, and gaps in datasets. 
The geographic extent of this project is limited to California coastal waters. Initial steps in this process include reaching out to repositories to obtain lists of kelp-related datasets within each platform with metadata including dataset name, program, contact name, and contact email/phone number.
