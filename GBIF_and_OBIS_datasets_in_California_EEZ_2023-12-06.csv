Long Term Monitoring surveys assess within-site community change over time, while Biodiversity surveys were designed to capture among-site patterns of community structure (abundance and spatial distribution of species). In combination, the long-term, targeted species approach and the biodiversity surveys provide a wealth of information about the structure and dynamics of rocky intertidal communities along the Pacific Coast of North America.</p>
<p>This metadata record documents the Point Contact surveys for the MARINe Biodiversity Surveys. Biodiversity surveys are comprised of four components, all sampled along the same transects: (1) point contact estimates of intertidal cover and substrate characteristics, (2) swath transects to estimate the density of seastars and abalone, (3) quadrat sampling to estimate the density of mobile invertebrates, and (4) topography (elevation relative to mean low low water (mllw)). Selected sites are resampled on a 3-5 year cycle. A site is defined as a contiguous rocky bench of at least 30m. Point Contact sampling consists of recording the diversity and abundance of invertebrates and algae along 11 transects of variable length extending from the upper intertidal to the low intertidal.</p>

<p>The data was then processed as follows:</p>
<p>1. Human sequences were excluded.</p>
<p>2. For non-CONTIG records, the sample accession number (when available) along with the scientific name were used to identify sequence records corresponding to the same individuals (or group of organism of the same species in the same sample). Only one record was kept for each scientific name/sample accession number.</p>
<p>3. Contigs and whole genome shotgun (WGS) records were added individually.</p>
<p>4. The records that were missing some information were excluded. Only records associated with a specimen voucher or records containing both a location AND a date were kept.</p>
<p>5. The records associated with the same vouchers are aggregated together.</p>
<p>6. A lot of records left corresponded to individual sequences or reads corresponding to the same organisms. In practise, these were &#34;duplicate&#34; occurrence records that weren&#39;t filtered out in STEP 2 because the sample accession sample was missing. To identify those potential duplicates, we grouped all the remaining records by &#96;scientific_name&#96;, &#96;collection_date&#96;, &#96;location&#96;, &#96;country&#96;, &#96;identified_by&#96;, &#96;collected_by&#96; and &#96;sample_accession&#96; (when available).

After completing training through RCCA, volunteer teams of divers select survey sites and perform surveys according to RCCA standard protocol. Since its inception in 2006, RCCA trained divers have conducted thousands of these surveys at hundreds of sites, including sites within more than 50 State Marine Reserves and State Marine Conservation Areas. 

At each site, buddy teams of divers conduct 18, 30 m x 2 m benthic transects to monitor key species of invertebrates, algae and fish. For fish and algae, size measurements are also collected. Finally, the substrate type, biological cover and relief of the reef are characterized, using a Uniform Point Contact (UPC) sampling strategy. Each site is divided into two &#34;zones&#34; by depth: shallow (5-12 m) and deep (12-18 m). These zones are distributed from offshore to inshore at sites with little depth variation. Half of the transects are conducted in each zone. RCCA‚Äôs survey methods are based on visual census survey methods developed by the Partnership of Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO) and have been modified so that they can be taught in a reasonable amount of time to volunteer SCUBA divers. Species are selected because of their ecological or economic importance or because they are of specific management interest. 

Data are presented as three comma-separated values (.csv) files: RCCA_occurrence.csv, RCCA_event.csv and RCCA_MoF.csv. The occurrence file contains the presence/absence and density for 33 invertebrate taxa, 9 algal taxa and 37 fish taxa, identified to the Genus or Species level. The event file contains the location of each site, the depth of each transect, and the date each transect was conducted. The Measurement or Fact (MoF) file contains temperature and visibility measurements taken at the beginning of each transect, the UPC data from each transect, the number of stipes for each giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) observed, the length for each individual fish observed, and the minimum and maximum size for each group of fish observed. This data set was transformed from its native format into a table structure using Darwin Core term names as column names.

After completing training through RCCA, volunteer teams of divers select survey sites and perform surveys according to RCCA standard protocol. Since its inception in 2006, RCCA trained divers have conducted thousands of these surveys at hundreds of sites, including sites within more than 50 State Marine Reserves and State Marine Conservation Areas. 

At each site, buddy teams of divers conduct 18, 30 m x 2 m benthic transects to monitor key species of invertebrates, algae and fish. For fish and algae, size measurements are also collected. Finally, the substrate type, biological cover and relief of the reef are characterized, using a Uniform Point Contact (UPC) sampling strategy. Each site is divided into two ""zones"" by depth: shallow (5-12 m) and deep (12-18 m). These zones are distributed from offshore to inshore at sites with little depth variation. Half of the transects are conducted in each zone. RCCA‚Äôs survey methods are based on visual census survey methods developed by the Partnership of Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO) and have been modified so that they can be taught in a reasonable amount of time to volunteer SCUBA divers. Species are selected because of their ecological or economic importance or because they are of specific management interest. 

Data are presented as three comma-separated values (.csv) files: RCCA_occurrence.csv, RCCA_event.csv and RCCA_MoF.csv. The occurrence file contains the presence/absence and density for 33 invertebrate taxa, 9 algal taxa and 37 fish taxa, identified to the Genus or Species level. The event file contains the location of each site, the depth of each transect, and the date each transect was conducted. The Measurement or Fact (MoF) file contains temperature and visibility measurements taken at the beginning of each transect, the UPC data from each transect, the number of stipes for each giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) observed, the length for each individual fish observed, and the minimum and maximum size for each group of fish observed. This data set was transformed from its native format into a table structure using Darwin Core term names as column names.

Long Term Monitoring surveys assess within-site community change over time, while Biodiversity surveys were designed to capture among-site patterns of community structure (abundance and spatial distribution of species). In combination, the long-term, targeted species approach and the biodiversity surveys provide a wealth of information about the structure and dynamics of rocky intertidal communities along the Pacific Coast of North America.
This metadata record documents the Point Contact surveys for the MARINe Biodiversity Surveys. Biodiversity surveys are comprised of four components, all sampled along the same transects: (1) point contact estimates of intertidal cover and substrate characteristics, (2) swath transects to estimate the density of seastars and abalone, (3) quadrat sampling to estimate the density of mobile invertebrates, and (4) topography (elevation relative to mean low low water (mllw)). Selected sites are resampled on a 3-5 year cycle. A site is defined as a contiguous rocky bench of at least 30m. Point Contact sampling consists of recording the diversity and abundance of invertebrates and algae along 11 transects of variable length extending from the upper intertidal to the low intertidal.
Please note that species of concern have been removed from all public datasets, as well as data from sites funded by the National Park Service (NPS) and the United States Navy.

Shorekeepers is a rigorous monitoring methodology. The key to getting reliable scientific data is to use standard survey methods so that everyone is collecting data in the same way over time at all sites. A monitoring guide developed by Fisheries and Oceans Canada presents an intertidal surveying methodology. The method is presented in a logical step-by-step manner starting from selecting a study area through each type of measurement to entering the field data into the database, and finally, reporting the results. After a few days of training in habitat mapping and species identification, community members can use these step-by-step protocols to routinely monitor their site of interest or concern. The challenge is to distinguish natural changes from human-induced ones over time. Nevertheless, the resulting data will help us all to gain a better understanding of these dynamic ecosystems, and to make wiser decisions about coastal development and marine conservation.

To detect gradual changes to habitats and local biodiversity, we need long-term data sets. Shorekeepers is about collecting detailed data annually at the same site(s) for three or more years.

As our population grows in coastal areas, so may our impacts on marine habitats. Protection of this fragile environment requires active participation and monitoring by local people and communities. Does there appear to be less marine life on a particular beach in recent years? Do you suspect that a nearby activity or industry is affecting the plants and animals of a particular shoreline?

Shorekeepers is stewardship of coastal marine habitats by people who live near them. It is a monitoring methodology designed specifically for community groups and for people who may not have a strong science background to be able to contribute to scientific data collection. Having local community groups and individuals take an active role in looking after their coastline fosters ""local ownership"" and interest.

DFO maintains the central database with the complete dataset from all shorekeeper surveys on the BC coast. The OBIS dataset is a subset of this larger collection and includes the date, location and percentage coverage of the intertidal area by various taxa.  Quantitative abundance and biomass values are not included in this dataset.  Information on the tidal cycle and the slope of the intertidal area is included in the notes.

The OBIS dataset is a subset of the Shorekeepers collection and contains presence information for intertidal zone taxa.  For the full dataset users should contact DFO."

It is named in honour of the distinguished botanist, Selmar Schonland, who did much to establish botany in South Africa, at Rhodes University and the botanical collections of the Albany Museum in the late 19th century. The herbarium is affiliated to Rhodes University Department of Botany and the Albany Museum.

Today the herbarium houses approximately 200 000 plant specimens, making it the 4th largest herbarium in South Africa and the 9th largest on the whole African continent. Taxonomic coverage is broad, and although the majority of specimens are Angiosperms, the herbarium has a very large collection of marine algae based on M.A. Pocock's work. Geographically GRA focuses on the flora of the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa, although collections from most parts of southern Africa are also available, including the Jacot-Guillarmod Lesotho material. The herbarium also has a limited number of specimens from other regions of Africa and other continents. Collections of several historically important collections include Burchell, Ecklon, Flanagan, Galpin, MacOwan, Pappe, Pegler, Rogers, Schlechter, Sim and Zeyher. Thanks to Schonland‚Äôs early exchange programmes the herbarium is exceptionally rich in type specimens."
